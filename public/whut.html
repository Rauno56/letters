      A postcard is a limited medium, but very appropriate for transporting the instructions to access the thoughts I actually meant to convey, but could not fit onto a card.
      There should be something on yours that resembles the following:
    </p>

    <h2 id="code-example">
      #123:abcDEFghiJK
    </h2>

    <ul>
      <li>#123 is a number, mainly for myself;</li>
      <li>: is a separator;</li>
      <li>The combination of letters, numbers and symbols “_”, “-” is your code .</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    This code, case-sensitive 11 characters, is meant to be entered <a href="/">here</a>.<br>
    If you have lost your card or rubbed off the code(how?!), let me know. I know yours by heart.
    </p>

    <p>
    My thoughts for each of you turned out so differently, it's difficult to describe all of them at once. The idea has been evolving over time and with that my ability to execute it.
    </p>

    <p>
    What I do want to say is: you all have played an important part in my life - been a role model, taught me something important, shared unforgettable moments. Said something that have made or changed me, my values or attitude towards life, people or myself.<br>
    </p>

    <p>This. Is. <b>Huge.</b></p>

    <p>
    And I don't know... maybe it's obvious! But maybe it is not? I know for a fact that I don't want to leave it up for a chance. The least I can do to show my gratitude to all you've done for me, is to say it out loud. What a miniscule thing to do as a thank-you.</p>

    <p>In a way I'm just a combination of all you. A delicious mix. A fruit cake. Nothing else.</p>
    <p><b class="bigger">Thank you.</b></p>
